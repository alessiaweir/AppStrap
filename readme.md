# AppStrap

What began life as a child theme of BootStrap 4 (a theme built by Taylor Young for HyprtxtBS4) has become a full-blown theme of it's own. AppStrap is now a Wordpress Theme built up from the bones of BootStrap 4.

I developed AppStrap as a BootStrap v4 theme for Wordpress with the use of Sass, FontAwesome and Bootswatch.
